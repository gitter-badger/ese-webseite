## What?

The **Freshmen week 2015** (we call it "ESE") will take place during the last week before the lectures begin, as per usual. During this time we try to make the start of your studies as smooth and easy as possible. There are several different events throughout the week covering topics such as enrollment and schedules, navigating the campus a tour through the city of Dresden and many more. Some of those event unfortunately take place parallel to the maths preparatory course ("Brückenkurs"), naturally we recommend attending the "ESE". You can have a look at the timetable for an overview of all the events that await you throughout the week. Or just come to the building of the computer science faculty on Monday morning and we'll tell you all about the things you'll need to know.

As to who "we" are: We are the [ESE tutors](fotos.html), senior students who like to help freshmen in their spare time. You'll be able to recognize us by our purple shirts.

## When?

The "ESE" will begin with breakfast on Monday at 9am. You'll need your **student id-card** (Studentenausweis) and if you'd like to get your canteen-card right away, you'll be needing your **e-meal certificate** (E-Meal Bescheinigung) and **10€** (5€ Deposit and 5€ credit).
